# PokemonWebsite

Creating Github to run sharable website of our best ML model for Pokemon Battles. 

Images for pokemon were downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arenagrenade/the-complete-pokemon-images-data-set/data.

We use Flask to create the website and create a sharable more permanent link using render.com. If the link has not been used for a while, it may take 1-2 minutes for the website to book up.
